# Conditional-GANs
This repo is about generating images of an given product with background images as promts or conditionals
I have used GANS archetecture for the model in which I have tried to condition the model so that it generates images of given dataset with the background of the given background images ,basically they act like promts or conditions due to which the model not only creates images similar to dataset but adds a backgrouund to it .
My Aim is to create advertisments given a image of a product 
dataset i have use-
1) product image dataset(shoes)-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/nike-adidas-and-converse-imaged
2) background image dataset(sports player)-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaswanthgali/sport-celebrity-image-classification
